# Tomb Of The Mask

A Tomb Of The Mask clone written in Bevy and Rust. Another one for the 20 games challenge, which I think should turn into the [A Game A Week](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-a-week-getting-experienced-at-failure#A%20Game%20A%20Week) challenge, because that's more the spirit we're trying to capture here.

## Goal

* Create at least one roguelike dungeon level
* Create a player character that can only move up, right, down and left on the respective keypresses. A direction keypress will make the character move in that direction until they reach the next obstacle (i.e. a wall)
* Fill the dungeon with PacMan style coins that the player collects on passing them 
* Add an exit tile to the dungeon level, to complete the level
* Add spikey walls that will kill the player if they stand in front of them for too long (i.e. more than half a second)


## Stretch goal

* Add screen shake 
* Add more levels
* Other stuff from the original Tomb Of The Mask
* Release to iOS, so we need to move the character on swipe gestures as well
